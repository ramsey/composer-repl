## About

This [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) plugin provides the `composer repl`
command.

REPL stands for *read-eval-print loop*. It's a language shell that reads user
input, evaluates the input using a programming language (in this case, PHP), and
prints the output to the screen. Then, it returns to the read state (that's the
*loop* part).

[PsySH](https://psysh.org) is the REPL providing the magic behind
ramsey/composer-repl. PsySH is a language shell for PHP. It's similar to
[irb](https://github.com/ruby/irb) for Ruby, [IPython](https://ipython.org) for
Python, and [JShell](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/tools/jshell.htm) for
Java. In addition to acting as a language shell, PsySH can also function as an
interactive debugger and development console.
[Laravel Tinker](https://github.com/laravel/tinker), [Drush](https://www.drush.org)
for Drupal, [WP-CLI shell](https://github.com/wp-cli/shell-command)
for WordPress, [CakePHP console](https://book.cakephp.org/3/en/console-and-shells/repl.html),
and [Yii shell](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-shell) are a few of the projects
using PsySH.

> üí° You may use this REPL without the Composer plugin functionality by requiring
> [ramsey/composer-repl-lib](https://github.com/ramsey/composer-repl-lib) instead.

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Installation

Install this package as a development dependency using
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

``` bash
composer require --dev ramsey/composer-repl
```

## Usage

Open your terminal and type `composer repl`. You may also type `composer shell`,
if you prefer.

You'll see something similar to this:

```
Psy Shell v0.11.1 (PHP 8.1.1 ‚Äî cli) by Justin Hileman
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the development console (REPL).
To learn more about what you can do in PsySH, type `help`.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>>
```

While in the dev console, you can do cool things like this:

``` php
>>> $hello = 'Hello, world'
=> "Hello, world"

>>> echo $hello
Hello, world

>>> foreach ([1, 2, 3] as $x) echo $x . "\n"
1
2
3

>>> $date = new DateTimeImmutable();
=> DateTimeImmutable @1598393282 {#6953
     date: 2020-08-25 22:08:02.643076 UTC (+00:00),
   }

>>> $getDate = fn (DateTimeInterface $dt): DateTimeInterface => $dt;
=> Closure(DateTimeInterface $dt): DateTimeInterface {#6964 ‚Ä¶3}

>>> t assertInstanceOf(DateTimeInterface::class, $date);
Test passed!

>>> t assertSame($date, $getDate($date))
Test passed!

>>> phpunit

## Environment Bootstrapping

The power of this REPL comes in its ability to act as a tool in your local
development environment. So, you might want to load parts of your environment
(i.e., configuration, objects, etc.), so you can access these from within the
REPL.

You can do this by specifying any number of PHP scripts to include in
`composer.json`, like this:

``` json
{
    "extra": {
        "ramsey/composer-repl": {
            "includes": [
                "repl.php",
                "tests/bootstrap.php"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Any variables set or configuration loaded from these scripts is available to use
from within the REPL.

For example, if `repl.php` contains:

``` php
<?php
$foo = 'bar';
```

And we use `composer.json` to load it with the REPL:

``` json
{
    "extra": {
        "ramsey/composer-repl": {
            "includes": [ "repl.php" ]
        }
    }
}
```

Then, when we're in the REPL, we'll see `$foo` defined:

```
>>> ls
Variables: $env, $foo, $phpunit

>>> $foo
=> "bar"
```
